# EvoGatekeeper (GSD-VGL)

A Claude Code plugin for spec-driven development with cryptographic verifier loops, TDD-first execution, and concurrent opencode agents.

## How It Works

EvoGatekeeper orchestrates software projects through a structured pipeline where no task can be marked complete without passing independent verification:

1. **Plan** (`/quest`) — Deep discovery + plan.yaml with phases, tasks, must_haves, TDD test specs, and per-task prompt files
2. **Execute** (`/cross-team`) — TDD-first implementation with parallel opencode agents, wave-based dispatch, and session continuations
3. **Verify** — Independent verifier in a fresh context checks tests, inspects code, and runs Playwright visual verification. A 128-bit cryptographic token is issued only on full pass
4. **Transition** — Stop hook validates the token, marks the task complete, and auto-transitions to the next task
5. **Iterate** — Failed verifications loop back through execution with evolutionary intelligence informing retry strategies

## Installation

### From GitHub

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
# Inside Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add RhizomaticRobin/gsd-vgl
/plugin install evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
```

Or via the CLI outside of Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add RhizomaticRobin/gsd-vgl
claude plugin install evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl --scope user
```

### From a local directory

```bash
# Inside Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/gsd-vgl
/plugin install evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
```

Or via the CLI:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/gsd-vgl
claude plugin install evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl --scope user
```

Use `--scope project` to install for a specific project, or `--scope local` for project-local (gitignored).

### Verify installation

Restart Claude Code, then run `/mcp` to confirm both MCP servers are loaded:

- `plugin:evogatekeeper:opencode-mcp` — agent dispatch (`launch_opencode`, `wait_for_completion`, `opencode_sessions`)
- `plugin:evogatekeeper:verifier-mcp` — verification (`verify_task`)

### Updating

After making changes to the plugin source:

```bash
claude plugin update evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
```

Then restart Claude Code for MCP servers to reload.

### Uninstalling

```bash
claude plugin uninstall evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
claude plugin marketplace remove gsd-vgl
```

### Other plugin commands

```bash
# Disable without uninstalling
claude plugin disable evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl

# Re-enable
claude plugin enable evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
```

Both MCP servers (opencode-mcp and verifier-mcp) auto-install dependencies and auto-build on first launch — no manual setup needed.

## Architecture

```
User
 └─ /cross-team → Lead Orchestrator (never writes code)
      ├─ Spawns 1..N Executor agents (concurrent where file_scope allows)
      │    └─ Each Executor (model: sonnet):
      │         ├─ Writes all tests (TDD Red)
      │         ├─ Dispatches gsd-builder opencode agents (1 per test, wave-based)
      │         │    ├─ Wave 1: fresh agents for independent tests (concurrent)
      │         │    └─ Wave 2+: session continuations for dependent tests
      │         ├─ Runs full test suite (TDD Green)
      │         └─ Calls verify_task(task_id) via verifier-mcp
      │              └─ Verifier MCP internally loads prompt, spawns Claude Code
      │                   └─ PASS → token → orchestrator validates → next task
      ├─ Validates completion tokens against .secret files
      ├─ Runs integration-checker at phase boundaries
      └─ Dispatches newly unblocked tasks
```

All opencode agents use the **gsd-builder** agent profile — hardcoded server-side in the MCP server. No web access, no destructive operations, temperature 1.0, no step limit.

## Core Concepts

### Verifier-Gated Loop (VGL)

The executor cannot complete a task. Only the verifier can, and it operates in a fresh context with an immutable prompt. The verifier generates a 128-bit cryptographic token (`VGL_COMPLETE_[32-hex]`) only when all checks pass:

- Quantitative tests pass in an independent subprocess
- Code contains no stubs/TODOs/placeholders (grep check)
- Must_haves truths, artifacts, and key_links are satisfied
- Playwright visual verification passes (qualitative criteria)
- SHA-256 integrity check confirms the test command wasn't tampered with

The stop hook extracts the token from the transcript and validates it against `verifier-token.secret`. No match = loop continues.

### TDD-First with Wave Dispatch

Every task follows: write tests first, then implement, then verify.

Implementation uses a **Test Dependency Graph** from the task prompt:

```
| Test | File              | Depends On | Guidance                          |
|------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| T1   | tests/auth.test   | -          | Create auth module, use bcrypt    |
| T2   | tests/api.test    | -          | Create API routes, mock DB        |
| T3   | tests/flow.test   | T1, T2     | Wire auth into API, test e2e      |
```

- **Wave 1**: T1 and T2 launch as fresh opencode agents (concurrent)
- **Wave 2**: T3 continues T2's session (most significant dependency) and is told to review T1's work
- Each agent gets exactly 1 test + specific implementation guidance
- `wait_for_completion()` after each wave; handle `input_required` questions via session continuation

### Goal-Backward Must-Haves

Verification checks three levels derived from the project goal:

- **Truths** — User-observable behaviors that must work ("User can log in and see dashboard")
- **Artifacts** — Files with real implementation, not stubs ("src/auth/route.ts exports POST handler")
- **Key Links** — Critical connections between components ("Login form POST /api/auth -> session cookie -> dashboard reads session")

### Integration Checkpoints

Phases in plan.yaml can set `integration_check: true`. When the last task in such a phase completes, an integration-checker agent is spawned before the next phase begins. It verifies cross-phase wiring: APIs consumed, data flows end-to-end, type contracts, no dead endpoints.

### Evolutionary Intelligence

EvoGatekeeper uses an evolutionary approach to improve execution strategies across iterations and tasks:

- **MAP-Elites Population Database** (`evo_db.py`) — Stores diverse approaches in a multi-dimensional grid indexed by island and behavioral descriptors. Each cell holds the best-performing strategy for that niche, preserving diversity rather than converging on a single optimum.
- **Island-Based Parallel Exploration** — On retry iterations with sufficient population (>= 3 approaches), the executor samples strategies from different islands and spawns parallel opencode agents, each following a distinct approach. This explores the solution space broadly before committing.
- **Cascade Evaluation** (`evo_eval.py`) — Each attempt is evaluated on multiple dimensions (test pass rate, duration, complexity) and stored back into the population. Failed approaches inform future exploration; successful ones are refined.
- **Evolutionary Prompt Construction** (`evo_prompt.py`) — Builds context-aware prompts from the population, surfacing the best strategies and common failure patterns from prior iterations to guide the next attempt.
- **Cross-Task Pollination** (`evo_pollinator.py`) — When a new task begins, successful strategies from similar completed tasks are migrated into its population, giving it a head start based on what worked elsewhere in the project.

This replaces static heuristics with a system that learns and adapts from actual execution outcomes.

### Plan Format

```yaml
metadata:
  project: "Project Name"
  dev_server_command: "npm run dev"
  test_framework: "vitest"

phases:
  - id: 1
    name: "Authentication"
    goal: "Users can register and log in"
    integration_check: true
    must_haves:
      truths: ["User can log in with email/password"]
      artifacts: ["src/auth/route.ts with bcrypt"]
      key_links: ["Login form -> /api/auth -> session cookie"]
    tasks:
      - id: "1.1"
        name: "Auth API"
        status: pending
        depends_on: []
        prompt_file: "tasks/task-1.1.md"
        file_scope:
          owns: ["src/auth/", "tests/auth.test.ts"]
          reads: ["src/db/schema.ts"]
        wave: 1
        tests:
          quantitative:
            command: "npm test -- --run tests/auth.test.ts"
          qualitative:
            criteria: ["Login page accepts credentials and redirects to dashboard"]
        must_haves:
          truths: ["POST /api/auth returns session cookie on valid credentials"]
          artifacts: ["src/auth/route.ts"]
          key_links: ["route.ts -> bcrypt.compare -> session.create"]
```

### gsd-builder (opencode agent)

The opencode MCP server hardcodes all spawned agents to use the `gsd-builder` profile defined in `templates/opencode.json`:

- No web access (websearch/webfetch disabled)
- **Context7 MCP server** for library documentation research (see below)
- Research-first `prompt` — agents must look up APIs via Context7 before implementing
- Bash (ask permission), Edit/Write (allowed)
- Temperature 1.0, no step limit
- 10-minute timeout per `wait_for_completion()` call

#### How Context7 MCP gets to opencode agents

```
templates/opencode.json          Canonical config (checked into gsd-vgl repo)
       │
       ▼ (copied at setup time by cross-team-setup.sh / setup-verifier-loop.sh)
<project>/opencode.json          Deployed to project root
       │
       ▼ (opencode reads from cwd on spawn)
opencode run --agent gsd-builder  Spawned by Better-OpenCodeMCP (opencode.tool.ts)
       │
       ▼ (opencode loads "mcp" section from opencode.json)
Context7 MCP server started       npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
       │
       ▼ (tools available to agent)
resolve-library-id, query-docs    Agent can research any library docs
```

**Deployment flow:**

1. `templates/opencode.json` defines both the `gsd-builder` agent profile and the `mcp.context7` server
2. During VGL setup (`cross-team-setup.sh` or `setup-verifier-loop.sh`), the template is copied to the project root as `opencode.json` — but only if one doesn't already exist with a `gsd-builder` agent
3. When the executor spawns an opencode agent via `launch_opencode()`, the Better-OpenCodeMCP server calls `opencode run --format json -m <model> --agent gsd-builder "<prompt>"`
4. OpenCode reads `opencode.json` from its working directory (the project root), loads the `mcp` section, and starts the Context7 MCP server as a subprocess
5. The agent's `prompt` field instructs it to use `resolve-library-id` then `query-docs` before implementing

**Key files:**

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `templates/opencode.json` | Canonical source — edit this, not deployed copies |
| `scripts/cross-team-setup.sh` (L40-48) | Deploys template to project root |
| `scripts/setup-verifier-loop.sh` (L18-27) | Same deployment for single-task mode |
| `Better-OpenCodeMCP/src/tools/opencode.tool.ts` (L68-100) | Spawns `opencode run` from project cwd |
| `Better-OpenCodeMCP/src/constants.ts` (L58) | OpenCode binary path |

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `stop-hook.sh` | Stop | Prevents exit during VGL. Validates token, auto-transitions to next task, injects integration check instructions at phase boundaries |
| `guard-skills.sh` | PreToolUse/Skill | Blocks plan-modifying commands during active VGL |
| `post-cross.sh` | PostToolUse/Skill | Shows next task in pipeline after /cross-team |
| `intel-index.js` | PostToolUse/Write,Edit | Indexes file exports/imports for codebase intelligence (bundled with sql.js) |

## Verification Immutability

The verifier cannot be tricked or bypassed:

1. **128-bit token** in `verifier-token.secret` (chmod 600) — executor never sees it
2. **SHA-256 integrity** — test command is base64-encoded with hash; tampering is detected
3. **Guard hook** — blocks plan-modifying commands during active VGL
4. **Prompt opacity** — verifier spawned via `verify_task()` MCP tool; executor never sees or touches the verifier prompt
5. **Independent execution** — `fetch-completion-token.sh` runs tests in a fresh subprocess
6. **Stub detection** — grep for TODO/FIXME/placeholder patterns in implementation files
