# EvoGatekeeper (GSD-VGL)

A Claude Code plugin for spec-driven development with cryptographic verifier loops, TDD-first execution, and concurrent opencode agents.

## How It Works

EvoGatekeeper orchestrates software projects through a structured pipeline where no task can be marked complete without passing independent verification:

1. **Plan** (`/quest`) -- Deep discovery + plan.yaml with phases, tasks, must_haves, TDD test specs, and per-task prompt files
2. **Test** -- Tester agent researches the domain (WebSearch + Context7), writes comprehensive tests, passes `assess_tests` quality gate
3. **Execute** (`/cross-team`) -- TDD-first implementation with parallel opencode agents, wave-based dispatch, and session continuations
4. **Verify** -- Independent verifier in a fresh context checks tests, inspects code, and runs Playwright visual verification. A 128-bit cryptographic token is issued only on full pass
5. **Transition** -- Stop hook validates the token, marks the task complete, and auto-transitions to the next task
6. **Iterate** -- Failed verifications loop back through execution with evolutionary intelligence informing retry strategies

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | >= 18.0.0 | MCP servers, hook scripts, installer |
| **npm** | (bundled with Node) | Package management |
| **Python 3** | >= 3.8 | Plan utilities, evolution engine, validation |
| **git** | any recent | Cloning, submodules |
| **jq** | any recent | JSON parsing in hook scripts |
| **Claude Code** | latest | The CLI tool that runs the plugin |
| **OpenCode** | latest | Agent dispatch for gsd-builder agents |
| **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** | -- | Auto-detected from subscription or set manually (see below) |

### Authentication for Verification Agents

The `verify_task` and `assess_tests` MCP tools spawn independent Claude Code subprocesses via the Agent SDK. Authentication is resolved automatically in this order:

1. **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var** -- if set, used directly
2. **OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`** -- if you're logged in to Claude Code with a subscription (Pro/Max), the OAuth access token is read and used automatically

Most users don't need to do anything -- just be logged in to Claude Code. If auto-detection fails:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
```

### Check prerequisites

```bash
node --version    # >= 18.0.0
python3 --version # >= 3.8
git --version
jq --version
claude --version  # Claude Code CLI
opencode version  # OpenCode CLI
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  # Optional if logged in via subscription
```

## Installation

### Quick Install (automated)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RhizomaticRobin/gsd-vgl.git
cd gsd-vgl
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap script checks prerequisites, builds both MCP servers, installs the plugin to Claude Code, and verifies the installation.

### Manual Install (step by step)

#### 1. Install Claude Code

If Claude Code is not installed:

```bash
# Via npm (recommended)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify
claude --version
```

See [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for alternative installation methods.

#### 2. Install OpenCode

If OpenCode is not installed:

```bash
# Via the official installer
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Verify
opencode version
```

OpenCode installs to `~/.opencode/bin/`. Make sure it's on your PATH.

#### 3. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RhizomaticRobin/gsd-vgl.git
cd gsd-vgl
```

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### 4. Build the OpenCode MCP server

```bash
cd Better-OpenCodeMCP
npm install --production=false
npm run build
cd ..
```

Verify: `ls Better-OpenCodeMCP/dist/index.js` should exist.

#### 5. Build the Verifier MCP server

```bash
cd verifier-mcp
npm install --production=false
npm run build
cd ..
```

Verify: `ls verifier-mcp/dist/index.js` should exist.

#### 6. Build hook scripts

```bash
npm install
npm run build:hooks
```

Verify: `ls hooks/dist/intel-index.js` should exist.

#### 7. Install the plugin into Claude Code

**Option A: Via the plugin system (recommended)**

```bash
# From inside Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/gsd-vgl
/plugin install evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
```

Or via the CLI:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/gsd-vgl
claude plugin install evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl --scope user
```

Use `--scope project` for a single project, or `--scope local` for project-local (gitignored).

**Option B: Via the legacy npx installer**

```bash
# From the gsd-vgl directory
node bin/install.js --global
```

This copies the plugin to `~/.claude/plugins/gsd-vgl/`, builds MCP servers, and makes scripts executable.

**Option C: Via npm (from any directory)**

```bash
npx gsd-vgl --global
```

#### 8. Verify the installation

Restart Claude Code (or start a new session), then:

```bash
# Check MCP servers are loaded
/mcp
```

You should see:
- `plugin:evogatekeeper:opencode-mcp` -- tools: `launch_opencode`, `wait_for_completion`, `opencode_sessions`
- `plugin:evogatekeeper:verifier-mcp` -- tools: `verify_task`, `assess_tests`

```bash
# Check commands are available
/gsd-vgl:help
```

### Updating

After pulling new changes:

```bash
cd gsd-vgl
git pull --recurse-submodules

# Rebuild MCP servers if source changed
cd Better-OpenCodeMCP && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cd verifier-mcp && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Rebuild hooks if changed
npm run build:hooks

# Update the installed plugin
claude plugin update evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
```

Then restart Claude Code for MCP servers to reload.

### Uninstalling

```bash
claude plugin uninstall evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
claude plugin marketplace remove gsd-vgl
```

### Other plugin commands

```bash
# Disable without uninstalling
claude plugin disable evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl

# Re-enable
claude plugin enable evogatekeeper@gsd-vgl
```

## Core Concepts

### Verifier-Gated Loop (VGL)

The executor cannot complete a task. Only the verifier can, and it operates in a fresh context with an immutable prompt. The verifier generates a 128-bit cryptographic token (`VGL_COMPLETE_[32-hex]`) only when all checks pass:

- Quantitative tests pass in an independent subprocess
- Code contains no stubs/TODOs/placeholders (grep check)
- Must_haves truths, artifacts, and key_links are satisfied
- Playwright visual verification passes (qualitative criteria)
- SHA-256 integrity check confirms the test command wasn't tampered with

The stop hook extracts the token from the transcript and validates it against `verifier-token.secret`. No match = loop continues.

### Test Quality Gate (assess_tests)

Before implementation begins, the tester agent's tests must pass an independent assessment:

- Are tests internally consistent (no contradictions)?
- Do they cover happy paths, error paths, edge cases, and boundaries?
- Is every must_have represented by test assertions?
- Are assertions meaningful (not trivial `expect(true)`)?
- Is test data realistic (not "foo", "bar")?

The assessor returns PASS/FAIL with specific issues. Tests are iteratively fixed until they pass.

### TDD-First with Wave Dispatch

Every task follows: write tests first (tester), then implement (executor), then verify.

Implementation uses a **Test Dependency Graph** from the task prompt:

```
| Test | File              | Depends On | Guidance                          |
|------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| T1   | tests/auth.test   | -          | Create auth module, use bcrypt    |
| T2   | tests/api.test    | -          | Create API routes, mock DB        |
| T3   | tests/flow.test   | T1, T2     | Wire auth into API, test e2e      |
```

- **Wave 1**: T1 and T2 launch as fresh opencode agents (concurrent)
- **Wave 2**: T3 continues T2's session (most significant dependency) and is told to review T1's work
- Each agent gets exactly 1 test + specific implementation guidance
- `wait_for_completion()` after each wave; handle `input_required` questions via session continuation

### Goal-Backward Must-Haves

Verification checks three levels derived from the project goal:

- **Truths** -- User-observable behaviors that must work ("User can log in and see dashboard")
- **Artifacts** -- Files with real implementation, not stubs ("src/auth/route.ts exports POST handler")
- **Key Links** -- Critical connections between components ("Login form POST /api/auth -> session cookie -> dashboard reads session")

### Security Model

Agent access is restricted through multiple layers:

- **Scope guards** (`guard-scope.sh`) -- PreToolUse hook blocks Read/Bash/Grep/Glob access to infrastructure files (tokens, prompts, plugin source, agent definitions) during VGL execution
- **Plan lock** (`guard-plan.sh`) -- PreToolUse hook blocks Write/Edit to plan.yaml and task files once execution starts. Unlocked on completion or `/run-away`
- **Orchestrator guard** (`guard-orchestrator.sh`) -- Blocks Write/Edit/WebFetch/WebSearch for the lead orchestrator during team mode
- **Token-at-call-time** -- Cryptographic tokens are generated inside the MCP tool handler at invocation, not at setup. Agents cannot pre-read secret files
- **Token validation** -- `plan_utils.py --complete-task` requires a valid token to mark tasks done
- **Prompt opacity** -- Verifier/assessor prompts are loaded by MCP tools internally; calling agents never see them

### Integration Checkpoints

Phases in plan.yaml can set `integration_check: true`. When the last task in such a phase completes, an integration-checker agent is spawned before the next phase begins. It verifies cross-phase wiring: APIs consumed, data flows end-to-end, type contracts, no dead endpoints.

### Evolutionary Intelligence

EvoGatekeeper uses an evolutionary approach to improve execution strategies across iterations and tasks:

- **MAP-Elites Population Database** (`evo_db.py`) -- Stores diverse approaches in a multi-dimensional grid indexed by island and behavioral descriptors
- **Island-Based Parallel Exploration** -- On retry iterations with sufficient population (>= 3 approaches), the executor samples strategies from different islands and spawns parallel agents
- **Cascade Evaluation** (`evo_eval.py`) -- Each attempt is evaluated on multiple dimensions (test pass rate, duration, complexity)
- **Evolutionary Prompt Construction** (`evo_prompt.py`) -- Builds context-aware prompts from the population, surfacing best strategies and common failure patterns
- **Cross-Task Pollination** (`evo_pollinator.py`) -- Successful strategies from similar completed tasks are migrated into new task populations

### Plan Format

```yaml
metadata:
  project: "Project Name"
  dev_server_command: "npm run dev"
  test_framework: "vitest"

phases:
  - id: 1
    name: "Authentication"
    goal: "Users can register and log in"
    integration_check: true
    must_haves:
      truths: ["User can log in with email/password"]
      artifacts: ["src/auth/route.ts with bcrypt"]
      key_links: ["Login form -> /api/auth -> session cookie"]
    tasks:
      - id: "1.1"
        name: "Auth API"
        status: pending
        depends_on: []
        prompt_file: "tasks/task-1.1.md"
        file_scope:
          owns: ["src/auth/", "tests/auth.test.ts"]
          reads: ["src/db/schema.ts"]
        wave: 1
        tests:
          quantitative:
            command: "npm test -- --run tests/auth.test.ts"
          qualitative:
            criteria: ["Login page accepts credentials and redirects to dashboard"]
        must_haves:
          truths: ["POST /api/auth returns session cookie on valid credentials"]
          artifacts: ["src/auth/route.ts"]
          key_links: ["route.ts -> bcrypt.compare -> session.create"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP servers not showing in `/mcp`

1. Restart Claude Code after installing the plugin
2. Check that both MCP server launchers are executable: `chmod +x bin/opencode-mcp.sh bin/verifier-mcp.sh`
3. Check that `plugin.json` declares both servers under `mcpServers`
4. Run the launchers manually to check for errors: `bash bin/verifier-mcp.sh`

### opencode agents fail to spawn

1. Verify opencode is installed: `opencode version`
2. Check that `opencode.json` exists in your project root (deployed automatically by cross-team setup)
3. Check the opencode binary path in `Better-OpenCodeMCP/src/constants.ts`

### Hook errors

1. Hooks require `jq` for JSON parsing: `jq --version`
2. All `.sh` files must be executable: `find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;`
3. Check hook debug log: `cat /tmp/gsd-vgl-stop-hook.debug.log`

### Build failures

```bash
# Rebuild everything from scratch
cd Better-OpenCodeMCP && rm -rf node_modules dist && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cd verifier-mcp && rm -rf node_modules dist && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
npm install && npm run build:hooks
```
